# EDA-ON-PLAY-STORE-APP-REVIEW-ANALYSIS
I'm using Python for the first time to do a thorough analysis of data from the Google Play Store. The research looks at more than 10,000 apps across several categories in order to better understand the Android app industry. The objective is to detect trends and create strategies to boost app market growth and retention.

# Google Play Store App Analysis
As the official app shop for the Android operating system, the Google Play shop is one of the biggest and most well-known Android app stores. Users may browse and download applications created with the Android software development kit and made available through Google using this platform. The Google Play Store dataset, with its enormous volume of data, may be used for analysis and prediction, which can yield insightful results for businesses and app developers.

# Tools
* Python
* Google Colab
* Tableau

# Project Overview
On the dataset of Google Play Store applications, we want to do data analysis and prediction in this project. 13 distinct characteristics in all may be used to forecast an app's performance utilising a variety of variables. We also have user review information that covers 5 distinct features.
The analysis is divided into three phases: data extraction, data cleaning, and data visualization.

**Data Extraction:** To ensure we have a large dataset for study, we extract the data from the Google Play Store website.

**Data cleansing:** To eliminate mistakes and inconsistencies in the dataset, we use data cleaning techniques in this step. To guarantee the correctness of our analysis, this step is essential.

**Data Visualization:** Using various plots and visualisations, we analyse the dataset after preparation in order to acquire insights and spot trends. To concentrate on the regions of interest and give a clear picture of the links within the dataset, we delete irrelevant data.

# Problem Statement
This project's main goal is to examine the Google Play Store dataset and provide definitive answers to important queries like app categories, pricing, ratings, app sizes, reviews, and user feelings. By answering these inquiries, we hope to offer developers and companies useful information they can use to improve their app-making processes and successfully target the Android market.

# Business Objectives
What kind of application can you find on the Play Store the most frequently? What impact does an application's cost have on its rating? What is the pricing distribution for apps? Which applications are some of the priciest ones? Which category do the priciest applications fall under? What impact does an app's size have on its rating? What connections exist between an app's cost, size, and price? What are the app's starting and end prices? What is the average app rating? How do app reviews affect the rating? Which app category has the most reviews? Which app category is the most popular in terms of installations? 
What are the Play Store's most popular categories? What applications have the most reviews been written about? How does the polarity of emotion differ between premium and free apps? What is the review sentiment percentage? Which app category has received the most favourable reviews?

By addressing these commercial goals, we hope to offer insightful information that will help app-creating companies succeed and assist developers in making data-driven choices in order to gain Android market share.
